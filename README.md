- 👋 I’m @Fred-Huffman
- 👀 I’m interested in architectural aspects of migration from desktop publishing to next generation web-based publishing. Adding computer and network security and protection. Recently purchased new local network equipment and added a duplicate Internet Service Drop (Charter/Spectrum). This in aftermath of suspected worm/trojan interference in an Android phone and YouTube AV session. New learning curves include separate Cable Modem and different Netgear Switch/router and Firewalla (Purple) Firewall.  
- 🌱 Current learning curve includes MalwareBytes VPN, Firewalla and Netgear configuration software, AZure, M365,  Exchange, Github, half a dozen flavors of Outlook, et.al.,  eccentricities of Windows 11, Dell XPS, and other key vendor Documentation...
- 💞️ Very open to collaboration and discovery of ways and means to fathom and filter design reference configuration, testing and maintenance knowledge out of the chaos and tsunami of Internet "information"
